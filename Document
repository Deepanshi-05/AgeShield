Step 2: System checks if the DOB meets the age criteria.
     ->If age is valid, proceed to the next step.
     ->If underage, restrict access.

Step 3: User is prompted to verify their age using one or more of the following:
     ->Facial Age Verification: User uploads a photo; AI model estimates age.
     ->Document Upload: User uploads an ID (e.g., Aadhaar card in India) to verify age.
     ->Real-time Selfie Verification: Compare the live photo with the uploaded document.

Step 4: System checks if the user is using a VPN:
     ->If VPN detected, prompt the user to disable it.
     ->If no VPN, proceed.
4. Validation and Feedback
Step 5: Validate all inputs:
